<b>Physics (MSc)</b>, Universit√© Laval

I'm working under the supervision of <a href="https://antoineallard.github.io"> Antoine Allard</a>
and <a href="https://www.jgyoung.ca"> Jean-Gabriel Young</a>. I'm mainly interested in numerical methods, Bayesian inference, Markov chains and hypergraphs.

When I feel like geeking out, I enjoy messing around with different Linux distributions and configuring my desktop. I also like to create vectorial figures and designs on Inkscape. Otherwise, in my free time I play table tennis, I play electric guitar and I sing.
