I am a PhD student in Physics at <a href="https://dynamicalab.github.io/">Dynamica</a> at Universit√© Laval, advised by <a href="https://antoineallard.github.io"> Antoine Allard</a> and coadvised by <a href="https://www.jgyoung.ca"> Jean-Gabriel Young</a>.

I obtained my Master's degree also at Dynamica in 2022 under the supervision of Antoine Allard and Jean-Gabriel Young.

I'm interested in the intricacies of the structure of complex networks.
I enjoy using Bayesian statistics and computational methods to improve our understanding of network models and properties.
